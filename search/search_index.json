Start an instance of OpenSearch that already includes the security plugin By default, we generally develop against a \"minimal\" version of OpenSearch, with no external plugins installed (such as when running yarn opensearch snapshot ). This is great to make sure we understand the basic behavior of the core app. But that's not how most users install or run OpenSearch - they generally use all the bundled \"default\" plugins, of which security is probably the most important. Install and run a \"full\" version of OpenSearch via tarball (Do this on the same machine where you're developing on OpenSearch Dashboards - these examples assume you're using an Ubuntu dev environment ) Make/navigate to a directory where you want to store/run OpenSearch tarballs Download the latest version of the OpenSearch tarball curl https://artifacts.opensearch.org/releases/bundle/opensearch/{VERSION_NUMBER}/opensearch-{VERSION_NUMBER}-linux-x64.tar.gz --output opensearch-{VERSION_NUMBER}-linux-x64.tar.gz for example, if you want version 2.1.0 , curl https://artifacts.opensearch.org/releases/bundle/opensearch/2.1.0/opensearch-2.1.0-linux-x64.tar.gz --output opensearch-2.1.0-linux-x64.tar.gz Unzip it: tar -zxf opensearch-{VERSION_NUMBER}-linux-x64.tar.gz cd inside and run ./opensearch-tar-install.sh (this is the only step necessary to subsequently restart the service) (The above is a slightly streamlined version of the official tarball installation documentation ) 2. Install the OpenSearch Dashboards security plugin Within the plugins directory of your local OpenSearch-Dashboards repo, clone the latest version of the security dashboards plugin: git clone git@github.com:opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin.git 3. Update the version strings to pass the version match test In plugins/security-dashboards-plugin/opensearch_dashboards.json update the opensearchDashboardsVersion and version strings to match the current version of OpenSearch Dashboards as defined in package.json . 4. Bootstrap Run yarn osd bootstrap to build the newly installed plugin. 5. Update your config with minimal settings The security plugin requires some config values to be set to start properly.

Build and Assemble Distribution and Artifacts Here you can see, the check-for-build job is a CRON job that triggers builds defined by the infra team.

Then this job reads the input manifest for the components defined and clones them in the docker environment. Then it executes the build scripts of OpenSearch Dashboards and then the build scripts of plugins, for example, reportsDashboards . If an explicit build script for a plugin is not defined here then it would use a default build script for the Core repo. If the builds were successful then it will execute the assemble workflow which essentially calls this script for each plugin.
